Google Photos is the home for all your photos and videos. Automatically organized and searchable, you can find photos fast and bring them to life. It’s the photo gallery that thinks like you do.

**VISUAL SEARCH**

Your photos are now searchable by the places and things that appear in them. Looking for that fish taco you ate in Hawaii? Just search “food in Hawaii” to find it – no tagging required.

**UNLIMITED FREE HIGH QUALITY STORAGE**

Automatically backup all your photos and videos. Access them on any device or on the web at photos.google.com. Your photos are safe, secure, and private to you.

**BRING PHOTOS TO LIFE**

Enjoy automatically created montage movies, interactive stories, collages, animations, panoramas, and more from your photos. Or you can easily create them yourself – just tap +.

**EASY EDITING**

Transform photos with the tap of a finger. Use simple, yet powerful, photo and video editing tools to apply filters, adjust colors, and more.

**SHARED ALBUMS**

Get everyone’s photos and videos in one place, across iOS, Android, and the web. Privately sharing all the photos you took – and getting the ones you didn’t – has never been easier.

**INSTANT SHARING**
Instantly share up to 1,500 photos with anyone – no matter what device they’re on. In the share menu, just tap Create Link.

**REDISCOVER YOUR PHOTOS**

It’s easier than ever to relive your memories. The Assistant can create collages of your old photos that help you relive the past.

**READY TO CAST**

View your photos and videos on your TV with Chromecast support.
