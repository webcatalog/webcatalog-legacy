For over 10 years, millions have trusted Basecamp’s unique blend of tools for everything their team needs to stay on the same page about whatever they’re working on. There’s nothing else like it!

Basecamp 3 is all new!

- Clientside - keeps client feedback and approvals organized and on the record.
- Pings - for quick discussions — like instant messages or direct messages.
- Work Can Wait - set your schedule so you don’t get notifications after work or on the weekends.
- Campfires - every Basecamp now includes a Campfire group chat.
- Applause - show someone you care by clicking the Applause button on any message, comment, document, or answer.
- Share anything with anyone - even if they aren’t part of a project.
- All that plus... Reports, Automatic Questions, @mentions, Bookmarks, Folders, Clientside, Drafts, Cascading Notifications, Basecamp Timeline and more!
